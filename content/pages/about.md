# Kentucky's Issues

### Education, Spending, Attitudes

David supports parents right to choose how their child grows up. Unmasking our kids and school choice.

### Term Limits

David believes that lifetime politicians are dangerous for our nation. Without a changing leadership in Washington, our representation becomes stagnant and the representatives lose touch with the voters.

The time for my opponent is up.
