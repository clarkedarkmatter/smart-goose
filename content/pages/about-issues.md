### Pro Life
David believes life begins at conception.<br>
He will fight to stop all federal funding to Planned Parenthood.

### Pro 2nd Amendment
The Constitution gives us the right to carry and bear arms.<br>
Any attempt to take away that right is an assault on our liberties and our Constitution.

### Election Integrity
Everyone must have an ID to vote.<br>
David believes that vote harvesting should not be allowed.<br>
Signatures must be compared and matched on absentee ballots with NO 3rd party requests for absentee ballots.

### Balanced Budget
Believes that we should have a balanced budget.<br>
It is the responsibility of our elected officials to pass a balanced budget.<br>
As households, we must live by a budget, so should our government.

### Unrivaled Military
As an 8-year army veteran, I understand the needs of the military and believe we must have the strongest, best equipped, and best trained military in the world.<br>
<br>As a disabled veteran that uses the VA Medical System, I understand the short comings and problems the VA Medical System has.<br>
<br>
Veterans should be in charge of their own health care.

### Police Support
We need MORE police officers, not less.<br>Look at Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle, New York, and Atlanta, in these cities, they are 'defunding' the police - and Crime is at an all-time high.<br><br>I blame our elected officials and the media for the hatred and rhetoric about our men and women that protect and serve us.<br><br>I believe the federal government should not tell the stateâ€™s how their police will operate.
