Want to help Trump and REAL Conservatives in 2022 and 2024?

### Jamie has been 'in' the Establishment too long to represent KY voters.
#### He won't take a stand when it really counts. He's too worried about re-election. Masks, vaccines, 2A rights - you don't have a champion in Jamie Jr.

Want to get term limits legislation passed?
***[David Sharp will bring a term limits bill to the floor within his first year](/support)***

### Comer is a weak Republican.

##### David Sharp isn't afraid of the liberal media or the Establishment 'rules'. We need REAL representation of Kentucky values in Washington before it's too late.
