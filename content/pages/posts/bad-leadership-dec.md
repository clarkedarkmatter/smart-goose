# Kamala and Biden are failing us.

Gas prices, inflation, polling problems, internal staffing issues. The list goes on and on.

Kamala's focus on herself and not the people of America is heartbreaking.

>She's bleeding staff and making a mockery of the office she holds.

## But we knew this would happen..

Yes, we knew that if the Democrats were put in power again, they would take no prisoners and burn it all down while they can.

# BUT

>We never could have imagined how WEAK the RINO representatives we sent to Congress would be in the face of this existential threat to our nation.
