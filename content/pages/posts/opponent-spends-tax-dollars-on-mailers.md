### Kentucky, your tax dollars at work..

> With our nation's debt and current crisis at the border, Comer's liberal, wasteful spending on his re-election campaign proves he is not the Kentucky Conservative he tells us he is. - David Sharp

If you are a current Congressman, you can use our taxpayer dollars to send out mailers to people in their district.

The establishment, professional politicians voted this in so they can keep their jobs.

### Whether you support him or not, an ***AVERAGE campaign mailer cost $1.37 per mailer.***

# That's about $70,000 of your tax dollars each time he sends one out.

> We have an extremely bad habit of overspending in Washington - our campaign seeks to reign in liberal spending and balance our budget.
