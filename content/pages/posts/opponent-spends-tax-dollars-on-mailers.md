### Kentucky, your tax dollars at work..

![Comer Mailer Preview](/images/blog/comer-card.png)

If you are a current Congressman, you can use our taxpayer dollars to send out mailers to people in their district.

The establishment, professional politicians voted this in so they can keep their jobs.

Whether you support him or not, an AVERAGE mailer cost $1.37 per mailer.

# Remember, that's $68,500 of your tax dollars each time he sends one out this race.
